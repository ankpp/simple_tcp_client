A simple TCP client

## Running the server
Once you have clonned the repository you can run the server with:
`python3 server.py`. It will open in *localhost* port **5000**

The server will take the console control, so you need to swich to a different one in order to use the client.

## Running the clients
Up to five client sessions can be open via `python3 client`. You have to use a different console for every instace of the client 
The connection will be automatically established. You should see the following messages:

*Connected*

*Enter your message or type 'DESCONEXION' to quit*
